## 📈 Ready for Next Development Phase

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **UI Development**: Build car listing, booking, and user management interfaces
2. **Business Logic**: Implement reservation system with availability checking
3. **File Uploads**: Add car image upload and management
4. **Search & Filtering**: Implement car search with filters (price, type, location)
5. **Payment Integration**: Add Stripe or PayPal for payment processing

### Recommended Development Approach
1. Start with basic car listing page using existing API
2. Add user authentication pages using NextAuth
3. Implement reservation creation and management
4. Add admin dashboard for car/user management
5. Enhance with advanced features (search, payments, etc.)
